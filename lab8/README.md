# Design Pattern used:
+ I have used the "Decorator" design pattern in this assignment. 
+ Decorator design pattern is most suitable for this scenario since we just need to extend or decorate the display functionality, by adding space and "/". 
+ Decorator pattern is most suitable for extending the functionality by adding new features.Â 
+ In this assignment, I have decorated the key(ch: String, cnt: int) method by wrapping the CreditCardExp with CreditCardExpDecorator and by wrapping the CreditCardNum with CreditCardNumDecorator.
+ Thus Decorator pattern helps to preserve the principle, "Closed for modification, open for extension"
